### Keep it tidy

A tidy home is a tidy mind or a wasted life, depending on which way you look at it. But a tidy file structure for designs/development is one that will make your life handier. Below is the file structure that I use:


I keep all my projects in a projects folder. 😱

Each project contains a sketch file, a folder for assets, and a folder for preview images. I use a naming convention that makes sense to me:

+ Folders are in lowercase with no spaces, underscores or hyphens. “superawesomefolder”
+ Sketch files are in camel case. “SuperAwesomeApp.sketch”
+ Images are in lowercase with an underscore between the name and usage of it. “icon_github.png”
